Deploying HTTPS services with Contour and cert-manager

Testing connectivity
You must deploy at least one Ingress object before Contour can configure Envoy to serve traffic. Note that as a security feature, Contour does not configure Envoy to expose a port to the internet unless there’s a reason it should. For this tutorial we deploy a version of Kenneth Reitz’s httpbin.org service.

To deploy httpbin to your cluster, run this command:

$ kubectl apply -f https://projectcontour.io/examples/httpbin.yaml
Check that the pods are running:

$ kubectl get po -l app=httpbin
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
httpbin-85777b684b-8sqw5   1/1     Running   0          24s
httpbin-85777b684b-pb26w   1/1     Running   0          24s
httpbin-85777b684b-vpgwl   1/1     Running   0          24s


 kubectl get ingress  -A
NAMESPACE   NAME      CLASS     HOSTS   ADDRESS                                                                         PORTS   AGE

You can delete the httpbin service now, or at any time, by running:

$ kubectl delete -f https://projectcontour.io/examples/httpbin.yaml
