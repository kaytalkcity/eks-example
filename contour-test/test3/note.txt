Apply the new rate limited manifest:

kubectl -n http-proxy apply -f rate-limit.yaml
Wait a few moments and then fire up a while loop to connecting to the service and watch it hit the limit after a few hits.

Note: You’ll need to hit CTRL-C to break the while loop.

$ while true; do curl -s rate.$INGRESS_HOST | grep -E 'h1|rate' ; done

<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>

^C
That’s it, rate limiting is enabled. This is incredibly useful if you have a service with known limitations or you want to restrict any one user from overwhelming the service.
